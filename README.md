This is my new portfolio page. 

Things I learned on this project:
 -CSS Animations
 -Keyframes
 -CSS Transitions
 -Making SVG elements
 -Clip-path
 -Media queries
 -Optimizing CSS for mobile devices
 -Using :before, :after, and :last-of-type pseudo-selectors
 -The ".closest" Javascript method
 -The ".target" Javascript method
 -Combining .closest and .target with the .click method to toggle properties of an element as long as the 
  clicked div is not said element or any of its children. (This didn't make it into the final design 
  because I scrapped the menu button in favor of a 1 page site.)
 -The CSS Overflow property

Problems that required solving:
 -Lack of browser support for pure CSS clip-path
 -Creating a responsive grid without a CSS framework
 -Desktop layout failed miserably on mobile
 -Allowing long blocks of text to scroll within its container div without the rest of the page scrolling (the About section)
